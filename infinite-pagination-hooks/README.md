# React app - Infinite Pagination

The project consists of an infinite pagination, consumes the api (http://sf-legacy-api.now.sh) that returns 100 items per page.

I created a loader for the user to realize that he reached the end of each page and see what new elements are going to be loaded.
And whenever you click in one of the items, the item becomes grayed out and persists even after refreshing the page.
